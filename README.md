## Overview

![Title](assets/sample_screenshot.png)

Welcome to the Investment Category app, where you can look at how a Project is devoting their time for a release or a date range. Use it to compare your expected investment to an actual plan or execution to facilitate alignment conversations and adjust investment.

This app looks at all work in the release, or if the app is not on a release-scoped page, you can choose a From and To date. When a From and/or To date are chosen, the app looks for stories that were marked as In Progress on or after the start date and Accepted before or on the To date. The Plan Estimates are then summed and grouped by the investment category of the initiatives they correspond to.

Any work that is not tied to a feature is categorized as "Unplanned Stories". Defects tagged as "Customer Voice" are marked as "CV Defects", and all other defects are "non-CV Defects". Stories that are tied to a Feature without an Investment Category are categorized as "None".

You can change the App Settings to select whether you only want to include Accepted Stories. This option lets you look at a release not only as what is planned (where you show all work), but also as what's been done (where you show only accepted work).
